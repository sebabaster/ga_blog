Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

This page is a good place to write about yourself, your project, your product, or whatever it is your site is for. You can replace the image above, or you can get rid of it entirely.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

Since August 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at DTU-Compute, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark. Previously, I was a doctoral student fellowship of INRIA, France. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in INRIA-Rennes in the Dionysos team (the current name is Ermine). For two years I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Supercomputing Center of Czech Republic. During 2017 and 2018, I have been a researcher in the Department of Computer Science in Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Prague. In the period between February, 2019 until to August 2023, I worked as scientific researcher in my former University in Czech Republic: VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, Czech Republic.
